CPU usage statistics

This is a statistical code for cpu utilization. Open test.cpp and run process_info.sh to complete the statistics.

This code is the method of counting the CPU utilization in our paper, just replace test.cpp with the main program of ORB-SLAM.

Since the paper has not been accepted, the complete code will not be released.
